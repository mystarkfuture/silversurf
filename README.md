# image-template

# Purpose

This repository is meant to be a template for building your own custom Universal Blue image. This template is the recommended way to make customizations to any image published by the Universal Blue Project:
- [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/)
- [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)
- [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/)
- [uCore](https://projectucore.io/)
- [main](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/)
- [hwe](https://github.com/ublue-os/hwe/) 

This template includes a Containerfile and a Github workflow for building the container image. As soon as the workflow is enabled in your repository, it will build the container image and push it to the Github Container Registry.

# Prerequisites

Working knowledge in the following topics:

- Containers
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnSH8Ht3MIc
  - https://www.mankier.com/5/Containerfile
- rpm-ostree
  - https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/container/
- Fedora Silverblue (and other Fedora Atomic variants)
  - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/
- Github Workflows
  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows

# How to Use

## Template

Select `Use this Template` and create a new repository from it. To enable the workflows, you may need to go the `Actions` tab of the new repository and click to enable workflows.

## Containerfile

This file defines the operations used to customize the selected image. It contains examples of possible modifications, including how to:
- change the upstream from which the custom image is derived
- add additional RPM packages
- add binaries as a layer from other images

## Workflows

### build.yml

This workflow creates your custom OCI image and publishes it to the Github Container Registry (GHCR). By default, the image name will match the Github repository name.

#### Container Signing

Container signing is important for end-user security and is enabled on all Universal Blue images. It is recommended you set this up, and by default the image builds *will fail* if you don't.

This provides users a method of verifying the image.

1. Install the [cosign CLI tool](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/how-to-install-cosign/#installing-cosign-with-the-cosign-binary)

2. Run inside your repo folder:

    ```bash
    cosign generate-key-pair
    ```

    
    - Do NOT put in a password when it asks you to, just press enter. The signing key will be used in GitHub Actions and will not work if it is encrypted.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful to *never* accidentally commit `cosign.key` into your git repo.

3. Add the private key to GitHub

    - This can also be done manually. Go to your repository settings, under Secrets and Variables -> Actions
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/216735595-0ecf1b66-b9ee-439e-87d7-c8cc43c2110a.png)
    Add a new secret and name it `SIGNING_SECRET`, then paste the contents of `cosign.key` into the secret and save it. Make sure it's the .key file and not the .pub file. Once done, it should look like this:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/216735690-2d19271f-cee2-45ac-a039-23e6a4c16b34.png)

    - (CLI instructions) If you have the `github-cli` installed, run:

    ```bash
    gh secret set SIGNING_SECRET < cosign.key
    ```

4. Commit the `cosign.pub` file into your git repository

## Rebase

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/mystarkfuture/silversurf:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/mystarkfuture/silversurf:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/#fresh-install-from-an-iso). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/mystarkfuture/heartsbane
```

## ISO Generation

```bash
mkdir ./iso-output

# for podman
sudo podman run --rm --privileged --volume ./iso-output:/build-container-installer/build --security-opt label=disable --pull=newer \
ghcr.io/jasonn3/build-container-installer:latest \
IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/mystarkfuture \
IMAGE_NAME=silversurf \
IMAGE_TAG=latest \
VARIANT=Silverblue

# for docker
sudo docker run --rm --privileged --volume ./iso-output:/build-container-installer/build --pull=always \
ghcr.io/jasonn3/build-container-installer:latest \
IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/mystarkfuture \
IMAGE_NAME=silversurf \
IMAGE_TAG=latest \
VARIANT=Silverblue # should match the variant your image is based on
```

## Post Install

Post install autostart doesnt work as expected. So, do this manually.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable brew-setup.service
sudo systemctl enable brew-upgrade.timer
sudo systemctl enable brew-update.timer
```

## TO-DO
- [ ] Postinstall Scripts
  - [ ] Brew
- [ ] Flatpaks
